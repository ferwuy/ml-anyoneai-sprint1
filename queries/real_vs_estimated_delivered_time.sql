-- TODO: 
-- This query will return a table with the differences between the real 
-- and estimated delivery times by month and year. 
-- It will have different columns: 
--      month_no, with the month numbers going FROM 01 to 12; 
--      month, with the 3 first letters of each month (e.g. Jan, Feb); 
--      Year2016_real_time, with the average delivery time per month of 2016 (NaN if it doesn't exist); 
--      Year2017_real_time, with the average delivery time per month of 2017 (NaN if it doesn't exist); 
--      Year2018_real_time, with the average delivery time per month of 2018 (NaN if it doesn't exist); 
--      Year2016_estimated_time, with the average estimated delivery time per month of 2016 (NaN if it doesn't exist); 
--      Year2017_estimated_time, with the average estimated delivery time per month of 2017 (NaN if it doesn't exist) and 
--      Year2018_estimated_time, with the average estimated delivery time per month of 2018 (NaN if it doesn't exist).

-- HINTS:
-- 1. You can use the julianday function to convert a date to a number.
-- 2. order_status == 'delivered' AND order_delivered_customer_date IS NOT NULL
-- 3. Take distinct order_id.

--1. **Filter Orders**: Include only orders with `order_status = 'delivered'` and non-null `order_delivered_customer_date`.

--2. **Calculate Delivery Times**:
--   - Real delivery time: Difference between `order_delivered_customer_date` and `order_purchase_timestamp`.
--   - Estimated delivery time: Difference between `order_estimated_delivery_date` and `order_purchase_timestamp`.

--3. **Group by Month and Year**:
--   - Extract the month and year from `order_purchase_timestamp`.
--   - Calculate the average real and estimated delivery times for each month and year.

--4. **Pivot the Data**:
--   - Use conditional aggregation to create separate columns for each year (2016, 2017, 2018) for both real and estimated delivery times.

--### Explanation of the Query:

--1. **`delivery_times` CTE**:
--   - Filters only delivered orders with valid delivery dates.
--   - Calculates `real_time` and `estimated_time` using the `JULIANDAY` function.
--   - Extracts the year (`%Y`), month number (`%m`), and month abbreviation (`%m` with `start of month`).

--2. **`aggregated_times` CTE**:
--   - Groups the data by `month_no` and `month`.
--   - Uses conditional aggregation (`CASE WHEN`) to calculate the average real and estimated delivery times for each year (2016, 2017, 2018).

--3. **Final SELECT**:
--   - Selects the required columns and orders the results by `month_no` to ensure the months are displayed in chronological order.

--### Output Columns:
--- **month_no**: The month number (01 to 12).
--- **month**: The 3-letter abbreviation of the month (e.g., Jan, Feb).
--- **Year2016_real_time**: Average real delivery time for 2016 (or `NaN` if no data exists).
--- **Year2017_real_time**: Average real delivery time for 2017 (or `NaN` if no data exists).
--- **Year2018_real_time**: Average real delivery time for 2018 (or `NaN` if no data exists).
--- **Year2016_estimated_time**: Average estimated delivery time for 2016 (or `NaN` if no data exists).
--- **Year2017_estimated_time**: Average estimated delivery time for 2017 (or `NaN` if no data exists).
--- **Year2018_estimated_time**: Average estimated delivery time for 2018 (or `NaN` if no data exists).
